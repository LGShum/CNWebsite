        <q>This book changed my view of how to work efficiently</q>
        <blockquote> - Ling, 2021</blockquote>
        <p>The 4 hour work week is a book which introduces the idea of having mini retirements the way he defines retirement is being able to do what you want to do without the consequences of being worried about your income. You could either work your whole life and build up a retirement or you could set up a business and earn passive income and have lots of mini retirements. The book suggest to either automates or outsources almost every task within your business. This ensures can be done from anywhere and you would only need to access emails once a day and because you have outsourced all the other admin roles your time is then freed up to do whatever you desire (hence retirement). In practise this is a good idea however logistically you would have to come up with a good business idea to put this into practise.</p>

        <q>This book made me change the way the stock market works</q>
        <blockquote> - Ling, 2021</blockquote>
        <p>Invested is a book which details the was the stock market how to research the different companies but looking at their fianancial statements and which sections to look at such as their net income, book value, sales and operating cash. These 4 numbers will help you decide whether a company is worth investing in as it will be an indication of how profitable a business is. It also talks about the stock market in general about index funds and how they work. This gave me the confidence to invest in the real world </p>

        <q>This book changed the way I viewed depression</q>
        <blockquote> - Ling, 2021</blockquote>
        <p>Learned Optimism is a book which details that if you're depressed there are steps you can take to view the world in a more positive light. One strong analogy from the book is that there was a study by which there were 3 groups of dogs were placed in a box. One group of dogs were able to escape a small shock by pressing a buttom. The second group of dogs were give the same small shock but they could not escape and there third group of dogs were not shocked at all. The dogs were then put in a different box with a divider by which they were given a shock and saw if they would jump over the divider to escape more shocks. The dogs in group one and three jumped over the divider however the second dogs just kept getting shocked. This is "learned helplessness" this can be likened to depression as when people are depressed they can't see a positive outlook. This was not the end of the experiment, the scientist physically moved the second group of dogs to safety once the dogs were given the shock and after a few times the dogs were able to "teach" the dogs to descape the shock just as the first and third group of dogs. If this analogy can work with dogs it can be applied to people. This makes me always have a positive look on life as i know that even when times are hard there can be a way to change that viewpoint</p>
