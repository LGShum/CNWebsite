        <p>The game is a moba like league of legends, DoTa 2, Heroes of the Storm and SMITE however this game is made be tencent</p>
        <p>Players battle it out with 4 other pokemon teammates to try and score the most "goals" as possible</p>
        <h2>How to play Pokemon Unite</h2>
        <p>You gain points by either killing random pokemon around the map or by killing the other team to get a percantage of the points in their bank  </p>
        <p>Simple Right?</p>
        <h2>WRONG!!!</h2>
        <p>The team also has three other objectives in the form of Zapdos, Rotom and Drednaw</p>
        <p>These three pokemon will give your team an advantage:</p>
